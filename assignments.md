## Assignment late penalties

We are flexible about submitting assignments late. Unless otherwise specified,
assignments may be turned in late with the following penalties applied to the
score received:

* 1 day late: −25%
* 2 days late: −50%
* &gt; 2 days late: we will not grade it.

Homework and programming assignments will be accepted up to 2 days late, but at
a penalty. The penalty is 25% for one day late, and 50% for two days late.

Late penalties may be avoided or reduced by obtaining an extension on the
assignment. However, any extensions must be approved by the instructor at least
two days before the due date—last-minute extensions will not be granted except
in exceptional circumstances. Extension requests should be made via Slack;
copying all group members on the request. They should include a description of
why an extension is being requested.

## Response times

Feel free to ask questions about assignments in the Slack channel. Please use
`#townhall` channel if the question is not expected to be private to avoid
having to answer the same questions repeatedly. We will aim to answer questions
within 24 hours. We shall do our best to answer questions asap, but this is best
effort. Even if these questions appear on the day of the deadline, responses may
take up to 24 hours. Start early; avoid asking question and expecting answers in
the last few hours of the deadline.

## Academic Integrity

You’re in college; you’re expected and encouraged to discuss your work with
others. That said, **everything you write for this course must be your own
original work.**

### Programming Assignments (Individual)

- Programming assignments must be completed **individually**.
- **Do not use LLMs** (Large Language Models like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) for programming assignments. They hinder learning and understanding of concurrent programming concepts.
- You are responsible for understanding and being able to explain everything you submit.
- All students must sign an Honour Code at the start of the course.
- Submissions will be subject to automated plagiarism checks.

### Research Mini Project (Groups of 2)

- The research mini project is done in **groups of 2**.
- **You may use LLMs** for the research mini project—they make you productive when exploring research problems.
- You must cite any AI tools or external sources you use, and clearly indicate what parts of your work were influenced by them.
- You are still responsible for understanding and being able to explain all submitted work.

### Consequences

Plagiarism or academic misconduct of any kind will be handled according to the
institute policy on malpractice and may result in disciplinary action.

**If in doubt, ask.** It's always better to clarify than to guess.
